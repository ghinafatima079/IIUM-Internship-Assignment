# Question 3: Face Detection & Feature Localization

This program detects faces and localizes facial features (eyes, nose) in images from a folder.

## How to run

From the Assignment root directory:

```
python q3/Q3_code.py
```

### Input Images

Place your input images in the appropriate folder (e.g., `q3/data/input/`). If you do not want to upload large image files to GitHub, you can upload them to Google Drive and share the download link in your documentation or with collaborators. Download the images from Drive before running the script.

The script will process all images in the specified input folder and output:

- Annotated images in `output/`

## Output

See `report.txt` for details about the output files and their interpretation.
