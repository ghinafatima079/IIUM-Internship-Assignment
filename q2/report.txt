# Q2 Output Report

This program analyzes vehicle scenes in images using YOLOv8 for vehicle detection. The output consists of:

- Annotated images with bounding boxes, vehicle type, color, and lane (saved in `annotated_images/`).
- JSON files with detailed vehicle information (saved in `results/`).

Each JSON file contains:
- Incoming/outgoing traffic flags
- Vehicle count
- List of detected vehicles with type, color, lane, and bounding box

Use this report to interpret the results and understand the detected traffic scene.
