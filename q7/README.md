# Question 7: Cat vs Dog Classification

This program classifies cat and dog images using a pretrained ImageNet model (ResNet18).

## How to run

From the Assignment root directory:

```
python q7/q7.py
```

### Input Images

Place your cat/dog images in `q7/data/cats_dogs_images/`. If you do not want to upload large image files to GitHub, you can upload them to Google Drive and share the download link in your documentation or with collaborators. Download the images from Drive before running the script.

The script will process all images in `q7/data/cats_dogs_images/` and output:

- Classification results in the console
- Misclassified images in `output/misclassified/`
- Misclassification report in `output/misclassified/report.json`
- Classification results in the console
- Misclassified images in `output/misclassified/`
- Misclassification report in `output/misclassified/report.json`

## Output

See `report.txt` for details about the output files and their interpretation.
